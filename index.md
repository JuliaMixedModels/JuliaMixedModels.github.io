    The aim in the posts/notes below is to cover questions and topics that we run into online and while writing our book *Embrace Uncertainty*.
    While we try to write clearly and balance intuition with rigor, we do occasionally make mistakes.
    If you find one, kindly let us know by opening [an issue](https://github.com/JuliaMixedModels/JuliaMixedModels.github.io/issues/new/) on GitHub.
